# TcpChannel : [IChannel](https://github.com/KaiNet-X/Network/blob/master/IChannel.md), IDisposable

This class is designed to be managed and generated by a client object, but can be used on it's own. This implementation of channel uses TCP to send raw, unencrypted byte data between endpoints.

Namespace: `Net.Connection.Channels`

#### Constructors

- `TcpChannel(Socket socket)` - Tcp channel communicating on a socket

#### Fields/Properties

- `IPEndPoint Local {get; }` - Local endpoint
- `IPEndPoint Remote {get; }` - Remote endpoint
- `bool Connected { get; private set; }`- Get or set connection state

#### Methods

- `void SendBytes(byte[] data)` - Send raw bytes
- `byte[] RecieveBytes()` - Receive raw bytes
- `async Task SendBytesAsync(byte[] data, CancellationToken token = default)` - Send raw bytes
- `Task<byte[]> RecieveBytesAsync(CancellationToken token = default)` - Receive raw bytes
- `void SetRemote(IPEndPoint remote)` - Only use when calling second constructor
- `int ReceiveToBuffer(byte[] buffer)` - Same signature as socket receive method
- `async Task<int> ReceiveToBufferAsync(byte[] buffer, CancellationToken token = default)`- Same signature as socket receive method
- `void Dispose()` - Closes the connection and disposes the channel
